## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

After cloning the repository, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

Create a `.env.local` file similar to `.env.example` and add your variables. Whilst in production we use PlanetScale, however, you can use any MySQL database in development mode thanks to Drizzle and Kysely abstraction. See [Drizzle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/drizzle). Once you have your database setup, run the migrations:

```bash
npm run db:push
# or
yarn db:push
# or
pnpm db:push
```

Finally, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
